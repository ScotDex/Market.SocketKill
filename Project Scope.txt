Project Scope: Corporation Geopolitical Radar
1. Executive Summary
A standalone, high-performance visual service designed to track the "Movement Velocity" of EVE Online corporations. Unlike traditional lookup tools, this focuses on the momentum of human capital—identifying recruitment surges and organizational collapses in real-time.

2. Data Acquisition & Automation
The system reuses the established background API to manage two distinct synchronization cycles:

Monthly Discovery (The Master List):

Automation: A script triggers once per month to refresh the master list of 14,000+ corporations.

Logic: It pulls current Alliance IDs, resolves their member corporations, and cross-references active IDs from the existing 24k killmail archive to ensure independent corps are captured.

Safeguard: Implements an idempotency check to ensure no corporation ID is duplicated or processed twice within the same cycle.

Daily Velocity Cycle (Member Counts):

Automation: A 24-hour rolling cycle to update the member_count for all 14k entities.

Batching: To respect ESI’s 1-hour cache, the list is divided into 12 batches (~1,166 corps each), executed every 5 minutes.

Snapshotting: Every 24 hours, the system generates a local snapshot.json representing the "state of the universe" for that day.

3. Comparison & Intelligence Logic
The core value proposition is derived from the Differential Analysis:

Net Change Calculation: The system compares the current 24-hour count against the previous snapshot.json.

Leaderboard Ranking: Entities are ranked by Numerical Gain (Recruitment) and Numerical Loss (Exodus).

Search Engine: A top-right search interface allows for instant filtering of the 14k-entry list. This searches against the local snapshot to ensure zero-latency results.

4. Visual & Technical Constraints
Aesthetic: Maintains the "CRT/Signal Intercept" theme. Gains pulse in phosphor-green; heavy losses trigger a red-alert strobe.

Infrastructure: Operates as a stateless experience separate from the primary container to ensure stability.

Compliance: Strictly honors ESI Expires headers and includes a mandatory User Agent for all background API requests to prevent rate-limit bans.

5. Success Metrics
Successful processing of 14,000 unique corporation updates within a 60-minute window.

Accuracy of the 24-hour "Net Change" leaderboard.

Search responsiveness under 100ms when filtering the local 14k dataset.

Does this scope capture the "Geopolitical Radar" vision accurately, or would you like me to adjust the frequency of the monthly discovery phase?
