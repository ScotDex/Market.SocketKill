## Development Philosophy

**Goal:** Properly usable, not feature-complete.

The market tool is a **utility**, not the flagship product. It should:
- Answer "which hub is cheapest?" quickly and reliably
- Look consistent with Socket.Kill branding
- Work on mobile
- Load fast
- Be maintainable

**Not trying to:**
- Replace zKillboard market tools
- Build comprehensive trading analytics
- Compete with EVE Marketer
- Add every possible feature

**Definition of Done (v1.0):**
- Core search works flawlessly
- Mobile friendly
- Shareable links
- Recent searches for convenience
- Proper error handling
- No blocking bugs

After v1.0, the tool is "done enough" - maintenance only, no major features.

## Future Tool Ideas (Post Market Tool)

**Interesting tools worth building:**
1. **Intel.SocketKill** - Local scanner (paste local, see hostiles)
2. **Loot.SocketKill** - Instant wreck value calculator
3. **Route.SocketKill** - Dangerous system highlighter
4. **Doctrine.SocketKill** - Alliance fit database
5. **Timer.SocketKill** - Structure bash tracker

**Pattern:** Build tools that tap into EVE's core appeal (conflict, risk, stories) rather than pure spreadsheet utilities.
